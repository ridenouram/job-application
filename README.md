# Job Application

Let's apply for a job somewhere wacky! Your choice. If it's hard to think of something fun, the default is apply to join the Mafia.

* Create a multi-page application using anchor tags 

    `<a href="page.html">`

* No script tag for your `index.html` landing page - that's only necesary on the interactive pages of your application.

* Your js should create `const` variables for all needed dom elements via `document.getElementBydId('id-you-want')`

* You'll need to add an event listener to the form submission and prevent the page refreshing with `event.preventDefault()`

* You only need to use simple input elements; radio buttons and text boxes, for example.

* You'll log successful user applications to the console.
